# Bankist Website

The Bankist Website project is a modern and interactive banking website that incorporates a range of features and functionalities. It provides users with a seamless and engaging browsing experience.

The website includes a modal window for displaying additional information or performing specific actions. Users can open and close the modal using buttons or the Escape key.

Smooth scrolling is implemented through a button that animates the scrolling motion, allowing users to navigate to different sections of the webpage effortlessly.

Page navigation is made easy with smooth scrolling anchor links. Clicking on a navigation link smoothly scrolls the page to the corresponding section.

A tabbed component is integrated, enabling users to switch between different sections of content. Clicking on a tab activates it and displays the relevant content area.

The navigation menu features a fade animation effect. When hovering over a menu item, other items and the logo are partially faded out, enhancing the visual interaction.

The navigation bar becomes sticky and remains fixed to the top of the viewport as the user scrolls down the page. This feature ensures easy access to the menu at all times.

Sections of the webpage are revealed gradually as the user scrolls, with fading animations creating a smooth and engaging visual effect.

Images on the webpage are lazy-loaded, meaning they are loaded only when they come into the viewport. This optimization technique improves the website's performance by reducing initial load times.

A slider component is included, allowing users to view and navigate through different slides. It supports both manual navigation through buttons and keyboard arrow keys, as well as dot indicators for slide selection.

The Bankist website project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript technologies. It provides an opportunity for customization and modification to create a unique banking website.
